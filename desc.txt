An android app named Argos, aimed at improving bike security in Vancouver. Collaborated in a group of three students,
Argos won first place out of 11 teams at the BCIT android development competition under the community category.
Argos helps users find secure places to park their bike, using maps showing locations of bike racks and bike theft iin Vancouver.

Argos uses the google maps api to display nearby locations of bike racks, as markers and clusters. The user can then toggle a setting,
showing all the bike thefts, overlayed as a heatmap.

The datasets for both the bike racks and bike thefts are stored in firebase and populates the map based off latitude and longitude.
Coordinates were not available for the bike thefts dataset, and therefore a geocoding api was used to convert addresses to coordinates.
